*tt_addons.txt*  Adds repo locations for my personal addons to VAM's database.

I've created a bunch of vim addons which are not ready for publication yet.

Normally I publish them by getting them added to the database of addons for
vim-addon-manager (VAM.)

The purpose of this addon is to make the locations of my unpublished addons
known to VAM.  This allows me to easily set up a new vim installation
which uses these addons.

More info on VAM at <http://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager>.

INSTALLATION            *tt_addons-installation*

The best way to install this addon is by cloning the git repository, e.g. >
    cd ~/vim-addons
    git clone http://github.com/intuited/vim-addons tt_addons
`~/vim-addons` may vary
depending on where you're keeping your VAM-compatible addons.

See |vim-addon-manager-plugin_root_dir| for more info.

USAGE                   *tt_addons-usage*

Once you've got it installed, you can just do >
    :ActivateAddons tt_addons
from within a vim session (assuming that VAM is active).

After doing so, you should be able to install my unpublished addons
by using |:ActivateAddons| normally.

Note that this may make the normal locations of some addons inaccessible:
for instance, I have had problems using some of Luc Hermitte's addons,
so I've forked them on github and added the forks to my unpublished addons.

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS    *tt_addons-wtf*

I'm not entirely convinced that this will work reliably,
especially if used in a .vimrc.

If you have problems, try doing >
    :call tt#addons#UpdateVAM('unpublished')
<

Enjoy!
